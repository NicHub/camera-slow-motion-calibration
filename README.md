## ABSTRACT

The goal of this project is to calibrate the slow motion frame rate of a smartphone.
14 LEDs are displaying a counter that counts from 0 to 16383 in binary.
The counter is updated at 1 ms interval with a timer.

## SETUP

This project works only with ATmega328P microcontrolers (ARDUINO UNO, Nano, Micro...).
Connect the LEDs to output 0 to 13

Super Slow-mo only supports HD reans. On Galaxy S21 5G and S21+ 5G, users can record approximately 0.5 seconds of video captured at 960 fps with approximately 16 seconds of playback. On Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, users can record approximately 1 second of video captured at 480 fps and digitally enhance the video to 960 fps with approximately 32 seconds of playback. Playback time can be edited in Super Slow-mo player.
